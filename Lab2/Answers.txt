Part 1: Linear Regression
1. When can you use linear regression?

2. How can you generalize linear regression models to account for more complex relationships among the data?

3. What are the basis functions?

4. How many basis functions can you use in the same regression model?

5. Can overfitting be a problem? And if so, what can you do about it?

Part 2: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
1. Why choosing a good value for k is important in KNN?

2. How can you decide a good value for k?

3. Can you use KNN to classify non-linearly separable data?

4. Is KNN sensible to the number of features in the dataset?

5. Can you use KNN for a regression problem?

6. What are the Pros and Cons of KNN?

Part 3: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
1. What is the basic idea/intuition of SVM?

2. What can you do if the dataset is not linearly separable?

3. Explain the concept of Soften Margins

4. What are the pros and cons of SVM?
